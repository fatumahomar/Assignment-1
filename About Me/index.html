   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>Hello Alt School, My name is Fatuma Abdulkadir Omar. I am 19 years old. I Leave in Nairodi, Kenya</p>
   <h4>Student ID:ALT/SOE/023/3381</h4>
   <h3>How and Why I joined Alt School</h3>
   <p>I was never intrested in Programming in the first place, I loved math so I wanted to learn accounting, just like my father, but one day my cousin sister visted and was staying with us for a while, and I saw that she was doing a project and i was so a invested and it looked cool. long story short, she ended up convincing me to do Programming. She told me that i could learn from this online school called Alt__School, I was not happy about it because my imagination of an online school was boring and lonely, but that imagination was shut down so fast after joining Alt__School, and now I am more than happy for joining this school more like this community. Since joined the school befor getting my high school results, the rest of my former school mates have asked me what i was going to learn after getting my results, and most of them were suprised that i was already learning, and learning something like Computer Science just a mounth after doing my high school exams.</p>
   <h3>Goals I want to achieve while in Alt__School</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>I want to gain new knowledge</li>
    <li>I want to learn a skill</li>
    <li>I want to get my first job in Programming</li>
   </ol>
